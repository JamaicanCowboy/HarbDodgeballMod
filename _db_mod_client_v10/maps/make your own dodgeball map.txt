The map file is here, but there is a few rules or it will not work properly.

1. Have the clientside files for the mod in your main folder when mapping
2. Leave everything in its place, feel free to retexture.
3. Make sure the walls are thick or the ball will fly through.

If you make a map come on the server and tell us, we will tell you what to do from there.
